Brief Introduction of Yourself
******************************

.. note::
    * Professional

      - Master of Science in Computer Science from UC Irvine
      - Solid in **Python** and **Java**
      - Web service development, experience with REST API
      - Working with data processing, build data profiles, design data metrics, preprocessing and query
      - Interest: backend service and large scale data processing and query


Challenging Project
******************************

.. note::

    - Design the digital profile of influencers utilizing the instagram graph api
    - Use scrapers to fix missing public information
    - Discuss with sales team
    - Discuss and learn with data engineer senior staff
    - come up with multithreading message queue allocate workers to acquire profile
    - bypass info limit with cutom tools, profile image detection, follower info collection reverse deduction

Fast decision
******************************

.. note::

    - Very normal when doing website backend support: fixing bugs
    - Emergency group discussion
    - Most impression: during 72 hour hackathon we found very identical project with only 5 hours left
    - Navigator inside subway station
    - group discussion on what to add: have map and routing. decide to record voice navigation and call for help button, subway schedule screenshot show case
    - risk of not able to finishing the project
    - eventually get most popular project

How to adjust for negative feedback
***********************************

.. note::

    - Analyze what we achieve, confidence rebuild, have clearer concept of remaining requirement
    - make plans on what to learn and improve: clearer plans give more confidence and avoid panic attack
    - ask more experienced people, communitcate with team mate
    - do more research

Biggest mistake
******************************

.. note::

    - tiny urls in instagram post redirecting to cutomer website with influencer coupon information
    - build a webpage report of the data flow, vital to showcase to customer
    - consult with sales team about what data to show
    - Decide to use python plotly dash to build a interactive single page web report
    - not familiar with the framework, chose a beautiful but complex one and start changing
    - takes too much time on the detail, blocks the demo showcase to customer
    - eventually discuss with senior staff, abandon the design and quickly build a skeleton report showcase all the data

Drawbacks in work
******************************

.. note::

    - Sometimes too obessessive in details and want to pursue perfectness
    - Feels bad to give a half done product
    - This cause too much time if a fask development is required

Develop in short time
******************************

.. note::

    - Discuss with team about the absolute basic requirement
    - Feeback on detail schedule and what functions are possible to deliver
    - build a inside webpage to view data on s3
    - discuss a immediate plan with senior staff, spent 2days give a basic html using jqeury datatable and python flask
    - report often about problems and adjust plans


How to learn new technologies
******************************

.. note::

    - First ask senior staff for recommendations
    - Depends on urgent task pending, if long check for complete tutorials and learn keywords and concepts
    - If short directly search for existing github code and reference and learn
    - Frequently summarize problems into a list and ask senior staff for help

Hardest Bug
******************************

.. note::

    - Range search for influencer profile
    - Must be tested in production bug
    - no sql
    - involves other team member

Conflict
******************************

.. note::

    - Need different computervision and nlp cloud service on influencer post and follower data
    - Want to directly use all features supported by AWS and generate a table of features, easy to maintain
    - After careful comparison I found out that GCP, AWS, IBM Watson and Microsoft Azure have different overlapping features
    - We need to combine different cloud service
    - Use table of available apis to ask sales team whether certain features help in the future
    - A group meeting with team leader and sales team, decide to move on with combination of multiple cloud api
    - Design parameter based worker so that we can use a parameter to choose which cloud service to use

Why Amazon

.. note::

    - Main experience in facebook api, aws cloud service
    - Very interested in cloud service and ai service
    - Good impression from lots of my classmates
    - Wider range of business and departments, has potential
    - admier focus on customer-first experience
